# Nhs-Family-Invoice [Android, Java, Firebase]
# Introduction & target audience
The goal of this project is to create a mobile application that digitalizes the Family
Voice - Carers Diary forms, which palliative care patients utilize as a health diary.
Typically, family members who serve as the patients' assigned carers fill out the
diary. To assist the data collection process and deliver fundamental aggregate
analytics and graphics, the mobile app will also provide additional features and
capabilities. These analytics will enable health specialists to monitor, track and
offer better care and assistance for their patients and families.
The Family Voice - Carers Diary mobile app will employ a straightforward formbased daily entry method that uses a 5-star rating system or an equivalent to
record the patient's pain, breathing, medication, food needs, and other pertinent
information. The team was asked to create a custom mobile app with the required
patient data, questions, and corporate logos.

# Justification of software design decisions
# Design & Layout
The Family Voice - Carers Diary Mobile App is a perfect example of a well-designed and user-friendly application. The designers of
the app have paid careful attention to detail, ensuring that the user experience is second to none. The app screen uses Fragments
instead of activities, providing a dynamic experience for the user. The Response and Response Summary screens have been
optimized using Recycler view, providing an efficient and effective way for users to view and manage data.
The app has been designed to be adaptable for any mobile screen size, ensuring that users can access the app no matter what
device they are using. The color pattern of the NHS has been followed, with the use of white and blue providing a professional and
trustworthy feel to the app.
# User Experience:
The user experience has been carefully crafted, with the app being simple and easy to use. Help texts and toast messages have
been included to guide users through the app, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free navigation. The simple approach makes it easy
for users to interact with the app and complete tasks quickly and efficiently.
# Data Persistence:
To ensure the safety and security of user data, the app uses Firebase Authentication and Firebase real-time database. The use of
these secure and encrypted cloud-based storage solutions provides users with peace of mind that their data is protected from
unauthorized access or leakage.

# Social, Legal, Ethical and Security Issues
# Legal:
• The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – The Family Voice - Carers Diary Mobile App will only collect
necessary data and will keep it secure in the cloud base database.
# Security:
• Authentication The Family Voice - Carers Diary Mobile App identify users in Firebase by using authentication – To
gain access to the app, you must have a valid email address and password.
• Storage – Firebase Realtime Database.
# Social & Ethical:
• Personal Data
• I'm only collecting the information I need for the app.
• It will never be shared and is kept safe.
• The app collects the personal info and feed back on patients medical conditions.
• Permissions
• The Family Voice - Carers Diary Mobile App will require access to the user's phone's camera/gallery and location.
• When using any part of the user's phone, the app will always ask for permission.
# Licensing Requirements:
The app complies with the licensing requirements of:
• Android Studio (Apache 2.0 license)


# Agile Development Method
What methodology was used? • The Scrum Framework was used in the development of this
application
• This methodology divides and prioritizes the project into
tasks.
• A couple of tasks are chosen each week, and a sprint is recorded
Why was the Scrum Framework used? • It has several advantages, including increased productivity
and the ability for members to stay organized so that
activities are accomplished efficiently and on schedule
Was it suited to the project? • Prioritizing tasks allowed me to get the app fully
operational so that I could test it while it's being
developed.
• Because I had a number of things to perform before a deadline, I believe this methodology was well suited to the project .

# The use of digital environments & tools
The professional tools used to develop this application are:
• Android Studio – "It includes code editing, debugging, and testing facilities all within an easy-to-use drag-and-drop
interface," according to the company.
• AVD Manager - is great way to test the app while developing before using a mobile device for later testing.
• GitHub (Git) - allows version control to help me track my commits to my repository. It also allows me to back track if
needed
• Jira – allows project management to help track down the issues and prioritizes them by the assigned deadline.
• Mobile Phone for Testing - used for testing the application at the end to see how it interacts with an actual mobile
device. Device used: Pixel 6a.
• Firebase Authentication and Real time database – allows login authentication and storing of data.
